    <h2>&#9432; Info</h2>
        <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). First identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, it resulted in an ongoing pandemic. The first case may be traced back to 17 November 2019. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely precipitated by a cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days. The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, most often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking.</p>

<div id="info2"><h2>Why did I create this code?</h2><p>I already saw about 5 COVID19 trackers on Sololearn, but some of them were displaying wrong data, some had awful UI, some had some bugs, etc. So I decided to create my own. Stats per each country will be added soon. Maybe.</p></div>
